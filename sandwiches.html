    <p>A FAMILY FAVORITE
Visiting the Berkshires to see the fall leaves and stayed in Pittsfield. Stopped here after the Harvest Festival in Stockbridge and bought the Bread and Chocolate. Returned several times during the week to buy more Bread and Chocolate loaves.  Then stopped by again before heading back to North Carolina to get more Bread and Chocolate loaves for the family. So many choices, but absolutely love Bread and Chocolate, so good.
